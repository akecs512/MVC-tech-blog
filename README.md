## Description

## System Usage
### Styling
Styling is done through Bootstrap 5 and basic css files located in the [css folder](/public/assets/css/).

### VSCode Extensions
VS Code should recommend the following extensions:
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Code Spell Checker
- React JS Snippets (even though this not a React project, the `clg` snippet is just too useful not to have)

### Package.json Scripts
These scripts have been added to help keep the code clean:
- `npm run lint`: checks for lint errors
- `npm run lint-fix`: tries to fix lint errors
- `npm run prettier-fix`: standardize all the formatting
